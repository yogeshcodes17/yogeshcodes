This question provides employers with an early preview of your core skills, your personality and your ability to respond to an unstructured question.</p><p>This is something you&#x27;ll be asked a lot at the beginning of an interview. Here are three tips that&#x27;ll help you nail the opener.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="be-succinct-honest-and-engaging">Be succinct, honest and engaging.<a class="hash-link" href="#be-succinct-honest-and-engaging" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><p>I call this the ‚ÄúSHE‚Äù formula. Resist the urge to give a detailed account of the last two decades of your career. The interviewer is looking for an answer that shows them you&#x27;re qualified and can respond to an unstructured question.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="use-the-job-description-to-prepare">Use the job description to prepare.<a class="hash-link" href="#use-the-job-description-to-prepare" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><p>Reread what they want and highlight the most required skills that you have. Are they looking for someone who can solve problems or deal with tough customers? Pick a few and brainstorm how you can describe yourself while showcasing your strengths for what they‚Äôre seeking.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="tie-your-story-to-their-needs">Tie your story to their needs.<a class="hash-link" href="#tie-your-story-to-their-needs" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><p>People love a good tale, so weave in some personality. For example, maybe you fell in love with the hospitality industry because your grandparents ran a bed and breakfast. Connect your story back to the job, keep it short, and be truthful.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="sample-1">Sample 1<a class="hash-link" href="#sample-1" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><p>From a very early age I&#x27;ve been a problem solver. I was that kid who would take apart anything so I could see how it worked‚Äîand then try to put it back together.</p><p>As you can imagine, it drove my parents nuts. But even though I tortured my family at times, the tinkering trait has served me well in my career.</p><p>After graduating from Purdue, I was recruited into a field technician job and got paid to take apart broken packaging equipment. It was like living the dream.</p><p>That job also made me realize I&#x27;m really good with difficult customers, and that&#x27;s what helped me land my current account manager role.</p><p>While I love my job and have been successful in it, it has moved me away from the manufacturing floor. Now, the reason I&#x27;m so interested in this position is that it seems to provide a really great blend of one-on-one work with clients and hands-on problem solving.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="why-this-answer-worked-well">Why this answer worked well:<a class="hash-link" href="#why-this-answer-worked-well" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><ul><li>He gave a vivid image of his childhood home and told a memorable story about it.</li><li>He picked two prominent required skills from the job description, problem solving and customer service, and built this interesting narrative around it.</li><li>He showed how his career successfully evolved before he was even asked about that.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="sample-2">Sample 2<a class="hash-link" href="#sample-2" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><p>In my current role as the marketing analyst responsible for a shampoo product line, my core responsibility is to assist the marketing manager to prepare the analytics for monthly sales, as well as a sales prediction model. I also manage the campaign budget, prepare wrap-up reports, and connect with our marketing agencies. All of this requires analytical thinking, attention to detail, and clear communication skills.</p><p>My current role has provided me solid execution experience in all the marketing aspects, including campaign planning, campaign management and analysis.</p><p>I am looking for a marketing manager role, where I can make a bigger impact as an individual contributor, as well as delve into strategic planning, and potentially grow into a people manager in a few years.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="why-this-answer-worked-well-1">Why this answer worked well:<a class="hash-link" href="#why-this-answer-worked-well-1" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><ul><li>Passion for the subject matter and clear direction for the future were apparent.</li><li>The answer focused on key skills and experiences relevant to the role (rather than a rambling biography).</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="sample-3">Sample 3<a class="hash-link" href="#sample-3" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><p>I would describe myself as highly curious and focused on learning in all parts of life, personal and professional.</p><p>In my professional life, I look for the hardest problems to solve and where I can learn and develop the most. I‚Äôve taken on many different types of projects, including ads, virtual reality, commerce, and messaging. No matter what I‚Äôm working on, I‚Äôm very invested. I identify anyone I can learn from, as well as problems that I care about and try to optimize every step of the process.</p><p>In my personal life, I spend a lot of time reading and usually have a focused area of interest for a longer period of time. For instance, last year, I read and researched public transportation systems and the future of transportation with emerging companies and autonomous vehicles. I found it fascinating, and it actually sparked a desire to change industries ‚Äî which eventually led me to my last role and even helped prepare me for the switch.</p><p>Outside of reading and researching, I also love to travel, cook with friends, and spend a lot of time running and being physically active outdoors.</p><p>Why this answer worked well:</p><p>Background and type of experience were clearly explained.
Candidate showcased a self-starter mentality.
Hobbies were framed to highlight benefits to professional life.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_31ik" id="sample-4">Sample 4<a class="hash-link" href="#sample-4" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><p>I‚Äôve been shipping consumer devices for the past two decades. Over the years, I‚Äôve built an expertise in firmware and bootloader designs.</p><p>I‚Äôve been lucky to have a few great mentors over the course of my career, and find a great deal of personal and professional satisfaction being able to do the same. I currently oversee a team of engineers and have helped grow several team members into managerial roles as well. </p><p>Additionally, I like to stay active within the industry community, and recently spoke at DeveloperWeek conference.</p><p>I‚Äôve been happy at my current role, have managed many successful product launches, and really enjoy management. I‚Äôd like to use my expertise to deliver more impact on a growing company ‚Äî to help grow and shape team and culture ‚Äîand make a significant impact in the market.</p><p>Why this answer worked well:</p><p>The answer was a well-rounded snapshot of professional interests and strengths.
It was clear that they‚Äôre active in the industry, and likely have a strong network.
An interest in mentorship shows a willingness to invest time in the company, and energy into team members.</p></div></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_35-E thin-scrollbar theme-doc-toc-desktop"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#be-succinct-honest-and-engaging" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Be succinct, honest and engaging.</a></li><li><a href="#use-the-job-description-to-prepare" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Use the job description to prepare.</a></li><li><a href="#tie-your-story-to-their-needs" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Tie your story to their needs.</a></li><li><a href="#sample-1" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Sample 1</a><ul><li><a href="#why-this-answer-worked-well" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Why this answer worked well:</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#sample-2" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Sample 2</a><ul><li><a href="#why-this-answer-worked-well-1" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Why this answer worked well:</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#sample-3" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Sample 3</a></li><li><a href="#sample-4" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Sample 4</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div></div>
