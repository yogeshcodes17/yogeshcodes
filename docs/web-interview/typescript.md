<p>
TypeScript has three primitive types that are frequently used: string, number, and boolean. These correspond to the similarly named types in JavaScript.

- string: represents text values such as “javascript”, “typescript”, etc.
- number: represents numeric values like 1, 2, 32, 43, etc.
- boolean: represents a variable that can have either a ‘true’ or ‘false’ value.
