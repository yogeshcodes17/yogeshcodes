<p>
React native is an open-source JavaScript framework designed by Facebook for native mobile applications development. It is based on a JavaScript library-React.

React Native saves your development time as it enables you to build real and native mobile apps within a single language â€“ JavaScript for both Android and iOS platforms, such that code once, run that on any platform, and the React Native App is ready for use with native look and feel.
