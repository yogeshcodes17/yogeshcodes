title: Overview

- System design is all about building robust, functional, scalable applications. 
- Where the coding interview serves primarily as an assessment of your problem-solving ability, the systems design interview is a test of your engineering knowledge veiled behind the facade of an open-ended design question.
- Systems design is the process of defining the architecture, product design, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. Systems design could be seen as the application of systems theory to product development.  

## Design Fundamentals
- System design interview questions are intentionally unclear(vague).
- It could be just stated in few words (design Uber, Facebook) and the interviewee should take that discussion to 45 mins interview.
    - We should able to answer how the system should behave.
    - Type of the system you're really building.
    - What kind of functionality the system supports. 
    - Characteristics we're gonna value in our system. 
- Performing investigations requires lot of design systems fundamental knowledge
- System designs is lot more subjectivity. A proposed solution may or may not 100% correct. 
- It's invterviewee job to explain why the proposed solution is the potential one.
- Using client server model to be able to design any modern day system. 
- Network protocols, we need to have some understanding of how machines communicate each other in order to be able to design a system properly.
- We'r talking about design fundamentals like
    - availability,
    - wait and see,
    - throughput
    - redundancy 
    - consistency 
- Components of a system
    - load balancers,
    - proxies,
    - caches,
    - rate limiting,
    - leader election,
- Real tech/services uses in a system
    - Zookeeper,
    - XCD,
    - Nginx,
    - Redis
    - AWS,
    - GCP
