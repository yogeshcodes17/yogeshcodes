title: Availability
---

The odds of a particular server or service being up and running at any point
in time, usually measured in percentages. A server that has 99% availability
will be operational 99% of the time (this would be described as having two
<b>nines</b> of availability).

### High Availability
Used to describe systems that have particulary high levels of availability, typically 5 nines or more; sometimes abbreviated HA.

### Nines
Typically refers to percentages of uptime. For example, 5 nines of
availability means an uptime of 99.999% of the time. Below are the downtimes
expected per year depending on those 9s:
- 99% (two 9s): 87.7 hours
- 99.9% (three 9s): 8.8 hours
- 99.99%: 52.6 minutes
- 99.999%: 5.3 minutes

### Redundancy
The process of replicating parts of a system in an effort to make it more
reliable.

### SLA
Short for "service-level agreement", an SLA is a collection of guarantees
given to a customer by a service provider. SLAs typically make guarantees on a
system's availability, amongst other things. SLAs are made up of one or
multiple SLOs.

### SLO
Short for "service-level objective", an SLO is a guarantee given to a customer
by a service provider. SLOs typically make guarantees on a system's
availability, amongst other things. SLOs constitute an SLA.
