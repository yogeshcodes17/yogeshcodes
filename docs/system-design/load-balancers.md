Relentlessly distributing network requests across multiple servers, these digital traffic cops act as watchful guardians for your system, ensuring that it operates at peak performance day and night.

### Load Balancer
A type of <b>reverse proxy</b> that distributes traffic across servers. Load balancers can be found in many parts of a system, from the DNS layer all the way to the database layer.

### Server Selection Strategy
How a <b>load balancer</b> chooses servers when distributing traffic amongst multiple servers. Commonly used strategies include round-robin, random selection, performance-based selection (choosing the server with the best performance metrics, like the fastest response time or the least amount of traffic), and IP-based routing.

### Hot Spot
When distributing a workload across a set of servers, that workload might be spread unevenly. This can happen if your <b>sharding key</b> or your <b>hashing function</b> are suboptimal, or if your workload is naturally skewed: some servers will receive a lot more traffic than others, thus creating a "hot spot".
